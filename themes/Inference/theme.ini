[Inference]
description = Certainly! Performing inference over a Bayesian Network is like using a puzzle to figure out missing information. 
    Imagine you have a puzzle with interconnected pieces, where each piece represents a different event or variable.
    Some pieces are already filled in with information (evidence), and you want to find out the most likely values for the missing pieces.
    <br>To do this, you use the connections between the puzzle pieces and the probabilities associated with them to logically deduce what the missing pieces should be. 
    You're essentially using the known parts of the puzzle to make educated guesses about the unknown parts, based on how they relate to each other.
    <br>Similarly, in a Bayesian Network, you have variables connected by relationships, and you might know the values of some variables (evidence). 
    Inference involves using these connections and probabilities to calculate or estimate the values of other variables. 
    It's like solving the puzzle of uncertain information by piecing together what you know to make informed conclusions about what you don't know.
