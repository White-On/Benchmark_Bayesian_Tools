description = Exact inference in Bayesian networks refers to the process of computing the exact probability distribution over a set of variables given some evidence.
    This is done by using the joint probability distribution of the variables and applying the Bayes rule. 
    The exact inference algorithm computes the posterior distribution by summing over all possible values of the unobserved variables. 
    This can be computationally expensive for large networks, but it guarantees the correct result.

extra_description = Exact inference in Bayesian networks is used to compute the posterior distribution of a set of variables given some evidence. 
    The posterior distribution is the probability distribution of the variables after taking into account the evidence.
    The evidence is represented by setting the observed variables to their observed values.
    The joint probability distribution is the product of the probability distributions of each variable given its parents in the network.
    The exact inference algorithm is guaranteed to give the correct result, but it can be computationally expensive for large networks.
    In practice, approximate inference algorithms are often used to compute the posterior distribution. 
    These algorithms are faster than exact inference, but they may not give the exact result.
