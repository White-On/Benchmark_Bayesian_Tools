Exact inference in Bayesian networks refers to the process of computing the exact probability distribution over a set of variables given some evidence.
    This is done by using the joint probability distribution of the variables and applying the Bayes rule. 
    The exact inference algorithm computes the posterior distribution by summing over all possible values of the unobserved variables. 
    This can be computationally expensive for large networks, but it guarantees the correct result.
