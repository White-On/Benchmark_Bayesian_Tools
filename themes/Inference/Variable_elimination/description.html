Think of a Variable Elimination as a smart way to answer questions about the puzzle (Bayesian Network) without having to look at the entire picture (full joint distribution) at once.
<br><br>In essence, Variable Elimination is a systematic way to navigate the Bayesian Network, leveraging the conditional independence relationships, and perform computations efficiently. 
It's like solving a puzzle by working on small sections at a time, asking neighboring sections for help, and gradually piecing together the final result.
