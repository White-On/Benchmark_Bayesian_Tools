<b>1. Starting Point</b>: You're given a question like "What's the probability of event A happening given evidence E?" This is like asking about a specific piece of the puzzle given some information you already have.
<br><br><b>2. Breaking Down</b> the Question: Variable Elimination is all about breaking down complex questions into simpler ones. You start by focusing on a small part of the puzzle (local factors).
<br><br><b>3. Message Passing</b>: Imagine you have a piece of the puzzle with missing edges. Instead of looking at all the pieces, you ask neighboring pieces about their missing parts. Similarly, in Variable Elimination, you ask neighboring variables about their probabilities given the evidence. This is the "passing messages" part.
<br><br><b>4. Summing Out Variables</b>: When you encounter a piece with too many possible values, you try to simplify it. In the puzzle analogy, this is like realizing a piece can fit in multiple places. In Variable Elimination, this is done by "summing out" variables. You merge all possibilities for a variable except the one you're interested in.
<br><br><b>5. Building the Answer</b>: As you keep breaking down the question, asking neighbors, and simplifying parts, you're building an answer. It's like assembling the pieces of the puzzle that matter to your question.
<br><br><b>6. Reaching the Answer</b>: Once you've asked all the right questions and simplified everything you can, you have your answer. You've effectively used the Bayesian Network's structure to calculate the probability you were interested in.
