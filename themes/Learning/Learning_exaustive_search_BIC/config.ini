description = Learning a Bayesian network refers to the process of automatically constructing a Bayesian network model from data, without specifying the network structure or conditional probability distributions beforehand. The goal of learning a Bayesian network is to identify the causal relationships among a set of variables and to estimate the conditional probabilities that describe these relationships.
