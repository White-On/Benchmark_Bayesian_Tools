The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, also known as relative entropy, is a measure used to compare two probability distributions. It tells us how different one distribution is from another, in terms of information content.
    <br><br>In the Bayesian Network context, you might use KL divergence to compare two probability distributions. For example, you could compare the predicted distribution of a variable using your Bayesian Network with the actual observed distribution. A smaller KL divergence indicates a better match between the two distributions.
    <br><br>So, KL divergence helps quantify the "distance" or difference between probability distributions, helping you understand how well one distribution approximates another.
