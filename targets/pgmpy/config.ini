[pgmpy]
description = PGMpy is a Python library for working with Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), which are graphical representations of probability distributions that allow for efficient computation of complex probability functions over many random variables. PGMs can be used to model a wide variety of domains, such as natural language processing, computer vision, bioinformatics, and social network analysis. PGMpy provides a set of classes for defining and manipulating different types of PGMs, including Bayesian Networks, Markov Networks, and Factor Graphs. It includes a variety of algorithms for performing inference and learning in PGMs, including exact inference, approximate inference, and parameter estimation. PGMpy also provides tools for visualization and evaluation of PGMs. PGMpy is an open-source library that is actively maintained and developed by a community of contributors. It has been extensively used in research and industry, and is considered one of the most popular libraries for PGMs in the Python ecosystem.
